        <p class = "parallax">Hello, I am a University of Michigian student studying in the school of
        Information. I'm interested in sustainable work. I also have an interest in
        screen printing. To see more of that go to my prints page. I took a printing
        class at the University. I hope to continue creating cool art work. I also
        enjoy watching television. Currently I am working in a research lab attempting
        to extract bamboo fibers from the culm. My current objective is Performance-driven
        School of Information student, with refined interpersonal and communication skills,
        interested in UX design, information analysis, and coding. I hope to create
        creative and sustainable work that solves complex problems for people and
        businesses. Seeking an internship in a fast-pace, innovative environment to
        enhance my skills through collaboration with cross-disciplinary teams. <br> <br>
        Some personal things about me. I love to hike. This past summer I visited the national parks
        in Utah. Nature really is amazing. I also got to visit lots of cities in the east. I
        have family spread out so I was able to visit Switserland, Germany, Spain, and Palestine
        in 3 weeks total. It was very crazy and also very carbon heavy. Next time I travel
        I need to think of the impact my travels will have.
